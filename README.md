# random-forest-extensions

Summer 2019 research focused on extending tree-based methods to handle correlated, high-dimensional, longitudinal
data. 

The code is divided into two folders: "Relevant" and "Scratch". The relevant folder contains code that is more pertinent
to our final algorithm, Free Tree (refered to as Long Tree at times). The scratch folder contains code that was
intially used for research and exploration, but is less likely to be relevant for future use and publication.
