simData_methods.R and Data Generator.R are both files with methods for simulating data with different data structures. 

ff_feature_selection_AR_data.R tests the feature selection ability of fuzzy forests on an auto-regressive (AR) dataset.
This code can easily be adapted for other algorithms or data structures.
